## 💡 About the Project
This project explores how emotional disorders such as anxiety and social phobia impact high school students’ social interactions. To address this, we developed a 2D narrative game designed to promote emotional awareness and empathy among teenagers.

Grounded in academic research and supported by field data from CEFET-MG (Contagem), its story unfolds in a school inspired by CEFET, following students navigating challenges of socialization and belonging, highlighting the obstacles their psychological disorders can create socializing in the school environment.

With 80.8% of surveyed students reporting emotional difficulties in school, the project reinforces the urgency of this discussion and demonstrates how games can serve as meaningful tools for reflection and engagement.

### 🕹️ About the Game
The game focuses on narrative, aiming to portray teenagers who struggle with social anxiety and other disorders, while engaging and immersing players through multiple forms of artistic expression, including its original soundtrack, story, and visuals.
The main character is a non-binary teenager named Alex, who is on a journey to overcome the need to hide behind psychological masks, with the help of friends they meet during their first days at a new school.

#### 🖌️ Visual art style
The game features a 2D pixel art style with a top-down view perspective, complemented by digital drawings used in cutscenes.

#### 👾 Game genres
The game’s narrative and interaction focus, combined with the opportunity to explore the map and the turn-based battle system, give it elements of multiple game genres, such as:

## 📝 Report Abstract
This research project investigates how emotional disorders, such as anxiety and social phobia, affect the socialization of adolescents within the school environment, encouraging reflection on the mental health of contemporary youth. The proposal consists of developing a 2D narrative game designed to promote emotional immersion as a means of raising awareness and fostering empathy. The production is based on academic studies and includes field research conducted with students from CEFET-MG, Contagem campus. The game was developed in Unity using C#, with visual art created in Libresprite, MediBang Paint and Krita, and an original soundtrack produced with Reaper. The narrative takes place in a school inspired by CEFET Contagem campus, following young characters as they deal with difficulties of socialization and adaptation. Four scenes were written, two of which were integrated into the game, accompanied by several original musical pieces that form its soundtrack. The research results indicate that 80.8% of participating students recognize that emotional and social difficulties have become highly present in the school environment, highlighting the relevance of the topic. By combining art, technology and research, the project seeks to shed light on the emotional issues faced by adolescents in educational settings.
